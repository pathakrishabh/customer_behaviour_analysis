Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis

Tech Stack: Python | SQL | Power BI

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes customer shopping behavior using transactional purchase data across multiple product categories.
The objective is to transform raw transaction data into actionable business insights related to spending patterns, customer segmentation, product preferences, and subscription behavior.

The project follows an end-to-end analytics workflow, similar to how data is handled in real organizations — from data extraction and transformation to visualization and decision support.

🎯 Business Objectives

The project aims to answer key business questions such as:

How do customers spend across different product categories?

Which customer segments generate the highest revenue?
